UCI ICS 46 Shindler Coding Project #4

I'm writing this at 2:32 AM where for the first time I actually want to save my work on a school project to remember it by.
I've spent the last few days grinding this assignment and I hope that in a few days I'll get back a good grade.
This is the wildest thing I've had to implement so far and I'm proud to have accomplished it the best I can.

Big thanks to my friends at UCI for making me like to go to school here. (Mahad, Ryan, Aidan, Hanvish, Kian, Ethan, Robin)!
